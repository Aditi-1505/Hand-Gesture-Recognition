Hand Gesture Recognition System
A Hand Gesture Recognition System is an advanced AI-based application that interprets human hand movements and translates them into meaningful commands or actions. 
Using computer vision and deep learning, the system detects hand gestures in real-time, enabling hands-free interaction with devices and applications.

Key Features:
1.Real-Time Gesture Detection – Recognizes hand gestures dynamically using a camera.
2.Deep Learning & Computer Vision – Uses CNNs and landmark detection for accurate recognition.
3.Multi-Gesture Support – Detects common gestures like thumbs up, OK sign, victory sign, stop, and more.

Applications:
1.Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – Controls smart devices, presentations, and applications with gestures.
2.Sign Language Interpretation – Assists communication for individuals with speech disabilities.
3.Gaming & Virtual Reality (VR) – Enhances gaming experiences with gesture-based controls.
4.Automobile Industry – Allows drivers to control infotainment systems hands-free.
5.Healthcare & Rehabilitation – Helps patients with limited mobility interact with technology.

This system combines AI, deep learning, and gesture recognition to create intuitive and touch-free interfaces for various industries.
